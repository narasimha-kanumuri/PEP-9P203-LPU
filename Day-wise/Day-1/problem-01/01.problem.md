Complement Pair with Distance Constraint

## 2. Problem Story / Context

A transaction monitoring system scans a stream of financial entries.

Each entry contains a numeric value. The system needs to detect whether any two transactions form a suspicious pair based on:

- Their values summing to a target value `T`
- Their indices being sufficiently far apart to avoid same-session noise

Your task is to identify such a pair efficiently.

Among all valid pairs, return the **lexicographically smallest pair of indices (i, j)**.

If no such pair exists, return `(-1, -1)`.

---

## 3. Inputs

- An integer array `values`
- An integer `T` (target sum)
- An integer `K` (minimum required index distance)

---

## 4. Outputs

- A pair of indices `(i, j)` such that:
  - `i < j`
  - `values[i] + values[j] = T`
  - `j - i ≥ K`
- If no valid pair exists, return `(-1, -1)`

---

## 5. Constraints

- 1 ≤ values.length ≤ 2 × 10⁵
- -10⁹ ≤ values[i] ≤ 10⁹
- -10⁹ ≤ T ≤ 10⁹
- 0 ≤ K ≤ values.length
- Expected time complexity: O(N) average

---

## 6. Edge-Case Thinking Prompts

- What happens when `K = 0`?
- What if multiple valid pairs exist?
- What if duplicates exist?
- What if all numbers are identical?
- What if `K > values.length`?
- Can negative numbers break your logic?

## 7. Sample Inputs & Outputs

### Sample 1

Input:
values = [5, 1, 3, 4, 2]  
T = 6  
K = 2  

Output:
(-1, -1)

Explanation:
5 + 1 = 6 but |0 - 1| = 1 < 2 ❌  
5 + 2 = 7 ❌  
1 + 4 = 5 ❌  
3 + 3 not possible  
4 + 2 = 6 and |3 - 4| = 1 ❌  
(0, 4) → 5 + 2 = 7 ❌  

There is no COrrect Valid Pair

(Students must verify carefully.)

### Sample 2

Input:
values = [2, 7, 11, 15]  
T = 9  
K = 1  

Output:
(0, 1)

---

### Sample 3

Input:
values = [1, 2, 3, 4]  
T = 100  
K = 1  

Output:
(-1, -1)

## 8. Thinking Like a Programmer

### What must be tracked?
Previously seen values and their indices.

### What can change?
Current index position.

### What must never change?
Target sum T.

### What brute force would do?
Check all pairs in O(N²).

### Why is brute force risky?
N can be up to 200,000.
