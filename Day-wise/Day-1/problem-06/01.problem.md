# 1️⃣ Title

Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters

---

# 2️⃣ Problem Story / Context

A log monitoring system receives a continuous stream of characters representing events.  

For performance analysis, the system needs to determine the **maximum length of a contiguous segment** of events that contains **at most K distinct event types**.

Your task is to compute this maximum length.

You must solve this efficiently because the event stream can be very large.

---

# 3️⃣ Inputs

- A string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.
- An integer `K` representing the maximum number of distinct characters allowed.

---

# 4️⃣ Outputs

- An integer representing the **length of the longest substring** containing **at most K distinct characters**.

---

# 5️⃣ Constraints

- `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5`
- `0 ≤ K ≤ 26`
- String contains only lowercase English letters.
- Must run in **linear time**.

---

# 6️⃣ Edge-Case Thinking Prompts

- What if `K = 0`?
- What if `K` is greater than the number of distinct characters in the entire string?
- What if all characters are the same?
- What if every character is unique?
- What if the string is empty?

# 7️⃣ Sample Inputs & Outputs

### Example 1

Input:
s = "eceba"
K = 2

makefile
Copy code

Output:
3

yaml
Copy code

Explanation:  
The longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters is `"ece"`.

---

### Example 2

Input:
s = "aaabbcc"
K = 1

makefile
Copy code

Output:
3

yaml
Copy code

Explanation:  
Longest valid substring is `"aaa"` or `"bbb"` or `"cc"` (max length = 3).

---

### Example 3

Input:
s = "abc"
K = 0

makefile
Copy code

Output:
0

yaml
Copy code

# 8️⃣ Thinking Like a Programmer

### 🔍 What must be tracked?

- Current window boundaries (left and right pointers).
- Frequency of characters inside the window.
- Number of distinct characters currently in the window.
- Maximum valid window length found so far.

---

### 🔄 What can change?

- Window size (expands and shrinks).
- Character frequencies.
- Distinct count.

---

### 🔒 What must never change?

- The window must always contain **at most K distinct characters**.
- Once violated → window must shrink.

---

### 🐢 What brute force would do?

- Check all possible substrings.
- Count distinct characters for each substring.
- Keep track of maximum valid length.
- Time complexity: **O(N²)** or worse.

Can we avoid recomputing distinct counts repeatedly?

---

📌 Follow the invariant:  
**At every step, the current window must contain ≤ K distinct characters.**
