# 1️⃣ Title  

Longest Gap-Free Streak Without Sorting

---

# 2️⃣ Problem Story / Context  

You are given an unsorted list of integers representing daily system activity IDs.  

Your task is to determine the length of the **longest consecutive streak of numbers** (gap-free sequence), regardless of order.

⚠️ You are **not allowed to sort the array**.

The algorithm must run in near-linear time.

---

# 3️⃣ Inputs  

- An integer array `nums`
- Size `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- Values may be negative
- Duplicates may exist

---

# 4️⃣ Outputs  

- Return a single integer  
- The length of the longest consecutive sequence

---

# 5️⃣ Constraints  

- `-10^9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9`
- Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
- Sorting-based solutions are not allowed
- Must handle duplicates correctly

---

# 6️⃣ Edge-Case Thinking Prompts  

- What if the array is empty?
- What if all values are the same?
- What if numbers are very large?
- What if sequence spans negative to positive?
- What if input size is 1?

# 7️⃣ Sample Inputs & Outputs  

### Example 1  

**Input:**  
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]


**Output:**  
4


**Explanation:**  
Longest consecutive sequence is `[1,2,3,4]`.

---

### Example 2  

**Input:**  
nums = [9,1,4,7,3,-1,0,5,8,-1,6]


**Output:**  
7


**Explanation:**  
Longest streak is `[-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]` → length 8  
But since 2 is missing, actual streak is `[-1,0,1]` and `[3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`  
Correct longest = 7

# 8️⃣ Thinking Like a Programmer  

### 🔹 What must be tracked?  
- Whether a number exists in constant time
- Whether a number is the start of a sequence
- Current streak length

---

### 🔹 What can change?  
- Current number being evaluated
- Running streak count
- Maximum length found so far

---

### 🔹 What must never change?  
- Membership lookup must remain O(1)
- We must not re-count sequences
- Each number should be processed only once

---

### 🔹 What brute force would do?  

Brute force approach:

- For every number:
  - Check if `x+1`, `x+2`, `x+3` ... exist
- Leads to O(N²) in worst case

Example worst case:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...,N]


Each element scans forward again.

---

## 🧠 Core Insight  

A number is the **start of a streak** only if `(number - 1)` is NOT present.

This prevents reprocessing.

---

## 🎯 Invariant  

> We only expand sequences from numbers that have no predecessor.

This ensures each element is visited at most once.

---

## 🧪 Mental Model  

Instead of growing from every number,
grow only from valid "sequence starts".

This guarantees O(N) behavior.
