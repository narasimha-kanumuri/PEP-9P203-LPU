# 1️⃣ Title

Duplicate Within K Distance

---

# 2️⃣ Problem Story / Context

You are monitoring a stream of integer readings coming from a sensor.

Due to signal noise, the same value may reappear. However, if a value repeats too soon (within **K readings**), it indicates a malfunction.

Your task is to detect whether **any value appears at least twice** such that the difference between their indices is **less than or equal to K**.

Return `true` if such a pair exists. Otherwise, return `false`.

# 3️⃣ Inputs

- An integer array `arr`
- An integer `K`

---

# 4️⃣ Outputs

- Boolean value  
  - `true` → if duplicate within K distance exists  
  - `false` → otherwise  

---

# 5️⃣ Constraints

- 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5  
- -10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9  
- 0 ≤ K ≤ n  
- Must run in better than O(N^2)

---

# 6️⃣ Edge-Case Thinking Prompts

- What if K = 0?
- What if array is empty?
- What if all elements are identical?
- What if K ≥ n?
- What if duplicate exists but distance > K?

# 7️⃣ Sample Inputs & Outputs

## Example 1

Input:
arr = [4, 1, 3, 4]  
K = 3  

Output:
true  

Explanation:
4 appears at indices 0 and 3  
Distance = 3 ≤ K  

---

## Example 2

Input:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
K = 2  

Output:
false  

Explanation:
No duplicates exist.

---

## Example 3

Input:
arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4]  
K = 1  

Output:
false  

Explanation:
Duplicate exists (1), but distance = 2 > 1

# 8️⃣ Thinking Like a Programmer

## What must be tracked?

- Elements inside a sliding window of size at most K
- Whether current element already exists in window

## What can change?

- Window boundaries
- Elements entering and leaving window

## What must never change? (Invariant)

At every step:

The window contains only elements whose index difference from current index is ≤ K.

If invariant is violated, logic breaks.

## What brute force would do?

- For each index i
- Check next K elements
- Compare all pairs

Time complexity:

T(n) = ∑ K  
Worst case → O(NK) → O(N^2)

Unacceptable for n = 10^5
