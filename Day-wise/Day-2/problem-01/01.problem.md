## 1️⃣ Title

- **Kth Missing Positive Number in a Strictly Increasing Array**

---

## 2️⃣ Problem Story / Context

- A robotics warehouse tracks item IDs using a strictly increasing sorted array of positive integers.
- However, some IDs were skipped due to manufacturing defects.
- Given this sorted array and an integer K, your task is to determine the Kth positive integer that is missing from the sequence.

- ⚠️ **You are not allowed to generate all missing numbers explicitly.**
- ⚠️ **The expected solution must run in $$O(\log N)$$ time.**

---

## 3️⃣ Inputs

- **An integer array `arr`**
  - Strictly increasing
  - Contains only positive integers
- **An integer `K`**
  - Represents which missing number to find

---

## 4️⃣ Outputs

- **A single integer**
  - → The Kth missing positive number

---

## 5️⃣ Constraints

- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le arr[i] \le 10^9$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$
- Array is strictly increasing
- No duplicates
- Must run in $$O(\log N)$$ time

---

## 6️⃣ Edge-Case Thinking Prompts

- What if the Kth missing number occurs before the first array element?
- What if all missing numbers occur after the last element?
- What if the array starts from 1?
- What if K is larger than total missing inside array bounds?
- What invariant allows binary search here?
- What monotonic property exists?

## 7️⃣ Sample Inputs & Outputs

### Example 1

#### Sample Input

> ```text
> arr = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11]
> K = 5
> ```

#### Sample Output

> ```text
> 9
> ```

- **Explanation (For Understanding Only):**
- Missing numbers: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10...
- 5th missing = 9

---

### Example 2

#### Sample Input

> ```text
> arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
> K = 2
> ```

#### Sample Output

> ```text
> 6
> ```

---

### Example 3 (Edge Case)

#### Sample Input

> ```text
> arr = [5, 6, 7]
> K = 3
> ```

#### Sample Output

> ```text
> 3
> ```

## 8️⃣ Thinking Like a Programmer

- 🔹 **What must be tracked?**
- How many numbers are missing before a given index.



- 🔹 **What can change?**
- The search boundaries (low and high pointers).

- 🔹 **What must never change?**
- The array remains strictly increasing.

- 🔹 **What would brute force do?**
- Iterate from 1 upward, count missing numbers one by one.
- Time complexity would be too slow for large constraints.

- 🔹 **What enables optimization?**
- A **monotonic function**:
- Missing count increases as index increases.
- This property allows binary search on the index space.
