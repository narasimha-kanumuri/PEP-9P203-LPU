## 📋 Title

**The Double-Swiped ID**

### 📖 Problem Story / Context

You are continuing your duties as a teacher at a **University**. The digital attendance system has a glitch: sometimes, a student swipes their ID card twice by accident, recording their presence multiple times in the log.

To ensure the attendance records are accurate, you need to scan the daily log and determine if any student has swiped their card more than once. Unlike the previous task where you looked for a specific student, here you do not know who you are looking for—you are simply looking for **any repetition** within the list.

---

### 📥 Inputs

1. **Integer $N$**: Representing the total number of swipes recorded in the log.
2. **Array $A$**: Of $N$ integers, representing the Student IDs.

### 📤 Outputs

* The **Student ID** of the first duplicate found.
* **-1** if all students swiped exactly once (all IDs are unique).

### ⚠️ Constraints

* $1 \le N \le 1000$ (A moderate class size, allowing for slower comparisons).
* $-10^9 \le A[i] \le 10^9$
* The array is **unsorted**.

---

### 🔍 Edge-Case Thinking Prompts

* **Single Entry:** What if the list has only 1 student? (Can a duplicate exist?)
* **Mass Duplicates:** What if every student swiped twice? (Which one do we return?)
* **Proximity:** What if the duplicate IDs are right next to each other (e.g., `[10, 10]`) vs. far apart (e.g., `[10, 20, ..., 10]`)?
* **Empty Log:** What if the list is empty?

### 🧪 Sample Inputs & Outputs

**Sample Case 1**

* **Input:**

    ```text
    5
    102 305 401 305 200
    ```

* **Output:** `305`
* **Explanation:** The ID `305` appears at index 1 and index 3. It is a duplicate.

**Sample Case 2**

* **Input:**

    ```text
    4
    10 20 30 40
    ```

* **Output:** `-1`
* **Explanation:** All IDs are distinct.

### 🧠 Thinking Like a Programmer

* **What must be tracked?**
  * We need to compare every student against every other student. This implies we need two trackers (fingers): one pointing to the **"current"** student we are checking ($i$), and another scanning the **rest of the list** ($j$) to see if that student appears again.
* **What can change?**
  * The position of the first finger ($i$) and the position of the second finger ($j$).
* **What must never change?**
  * The values in the array $A$ (we are reading, not modifying).
* **What brute force would do?**
    1. Pick the first person. Scan the entire remaining list to see if they appear again.
    2. If not, pick the second person. Scan the remaining list for them.
    3. Repeat until a match is found or we run out of people.

> **Note:** Because $N$ is small (up to 1000), an $O(N^2)$ approach (Nested Loops) is acceptable here, even though it is slower than hashing.
