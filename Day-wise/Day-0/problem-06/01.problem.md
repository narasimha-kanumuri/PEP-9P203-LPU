#### Title
**The Shared User Session**
*(Classic Logic: Intersection of Two Arrays)*

#### Problem Story / Context
You are analyzing user activity logs for a global application. The application has two major regional servers: **Server A** (North America) and **Server B** (Europe).

You have been given two raw log files containing **User IDs** (integers) from a specific time window.
*   `logA`: List of users active on Server A.
*   `logB`: List of users active on Server B.

Your task is to identify the **Cross-Region Users**: specific users who logged into **both** servers during this time window. The security team needs this list to check for account sharing or suspicious simultaneous logins.

The result must contain **unique** User IDs only. If User `#123` appears five times in `logA` and twice in `logB`, they should appear exactly **once** in your final list.

#### Inputs
1.  `nums1`: An integer array representing logs from Server A.
    *   Length $N$: $0 \le N \le 1000$.
2.  `nums2`: An integer array representing logs from Server B.
    *   Length $M$: $0 \le M \le 1000$.

#### Outputs
1.  An integer array containing the unique intersection of elements.
    *   The order of the result does not matter.

#### Constraints
*   **Time Complexity:** Target **$O(N + M)$**.
    *   A brute force approach comparing every element of `nums1` to every element of `nums2` would result in $O(N \times M)$, which scales poorly.
*   **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$ or $O(M)$ to store one of the logs in a Set for fast lookups.

#### Edge-Case Thinking Prompts
*   What if one or both arrays are empty?
*   What if there is absolutely no overlap between the users?
*   What if a user appears multiple times in `nums1` and multiple times in `nums2`? (The output must still be unique).
*   Does the size difference matter? (Should we hash the smaller array or the larger one?)

#### Sample Inputs & Outputs

**Sample 1:**
```text
Input:
nums1 =
nums2 =

Output:
Explanation: Only User 2 is present in both logs.
```

**Sample 2:**
```text
Input:
nums1 =
nums2 =

Output: or
Explanation: Users 9 and 4 appear in both. Duplicates (like 9 appearing twice in nums2) are ignored in the result.
```

#### Thinking Like a Programmer
*   **The Conflict:** We have two piles of unorganized data. To check if a specific item from Pile A is in Pile B, we normally have to dig through Pile B entirely. Doing this for every item in Pile A is exhausting ($N \times M$).
*   **The Solution:** We need to turn one pile into a "Checklist" (Hash Set).
*   **The Invariant:** An ID is added to our result list **if and only if** it exists in the "Checklist" of the first array AND we encounter it while walking through the second array.
*   **Uniqueness:** Using a Set automatically handles the requirement to ignore duplicates within a single log file.
