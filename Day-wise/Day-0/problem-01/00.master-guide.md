## 🔖 Topic: Linear Search (Sequential Access)

**Core Concepts:** Iteration, Conditional Logic, Array Traversal, Sentinel Values, Time Complexity $O(N)$.
**Target Audience:** Beginner (CS101)
**Estimated Total Time:** 45 Minutes
**Prerequisites:** Variables, For/While Loops, Zero-based Indexing.
**Follow-up Topics:** Finding Maximum/Minimum, Frequency Counting, Binary Search (requires sorting).

## A. Time-Boxed Teaching / Learning Flow

This schedule is designed to force active derivation of the logic rather than passive consumption of code.

| Phase | Time | Goal | Mental Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Problem Framing** | 5 min | Understand why we search sequentially. | **"The Shuffled Deck":** You cannot find the Ace of Spades in a shuffled deck without looking at every card until you find it. |
| **2. Constraint Analysis** | 5 min | Prove that skipping elements is unsafe. | **"The Black Box":** If you skip index $i$, the target might be there. You cannot know without looking. |
| **3. Visual Dry Run** | 10 min | Create the Trace Table (paper/whiteboard). | **"The Moving Finger":** Your finger points to one item at a time. It cannot move to $i+1$ until $i$ is checked. |
| **4. Code Writing** | 10 min | Translate the "finger" logic to syntax. | **"The Loop as a Robot":** The loop variable $i$ is the robot's position tracker. |
| **5. Complexity** | 10 min | Analyze "Work Done" vs. "Input Size". | **"Worst-Case Scenario":** The item is at the very end, or not there at all. We did $N$ units of work. |
| **6. Variant Thinking** | 5 min | Adapt logic to slightly different requirements. | **"First vs. All":** Do we stop at the first match, or keep going to count them all? |

## B. Teaching Process (Trainer View)

* **The Hook:** Ask, "If I give you a phone book that is not sorted alphabetically, how do you find 'Smith'?" (Answer: You have to read every single name).
* **The Trap:** Students often forget to handle the "Not Found" case. Ask: "What happens if the loop finishes and we haven't returned anything?"
* **The Invariant:** Emphasize that at index $i$, we know for a fact that the target is not at indices $0$ to $i-1$. This certainty grows with every step.
* **Forbidden Phrase:** Do not say "Just use a for loop." Instead say, "How do we inspect every location exactly once?"

## C. Learning Process (Student View)

**Mandatory Reading Order:**

1. **problem.md:** Understand the constraints (unsorted data).
2. **implementation.md:** Visualize the pointer movement and state changes.
3. **solution.md:** Read the production code only after understanding the logic.
4. **solution-implementation.md:** Review the specific syntax (`i++`, `break`, `return`) used.
5. **master-guide.md:** Use this file to self-assess mastery.

## D. Difficulty Progression Tag

| Level | Problem Type | Concept Added |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | Print Array | Loop syntax, Indexing. |
| **Current** | **Linear Search** | **Conditional (`if`) inside a Loop.** |
| **Next-Level** | Find Max/Min | State tracking (keeping the "best so far"). |
| **Extension** | Count Occurrences | Removing the "early exit" optimization. |
| **Advanced** | Binary Search | Reducing search space (requires sorted input). |

## E. Success Checklist

A student has mastered this topic only if they can:

* [ ] Explain why we cannot jump index $0 \to 5$ in an unsorted array.
* [ ] Predict the return value for an empty array `[]` without running code.
* [ ] Trace the values of `i` and `arr[i]` on paper for a "Not Found" case.
* [ ] Justify why the time complexity is $O(N)$ (Linear) and not $O(1)$ (Constant).
* [ ] Modify the code to return the last occurrence of the target instead of the first.
