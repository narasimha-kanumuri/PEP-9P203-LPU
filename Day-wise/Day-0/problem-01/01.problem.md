## 📋 Title

**The Lost Student ID**

### 📖 Problem Story / Context

You are a teacher at a top **University** managing a large class. You have a digital attendance log represented as a list of student IDs (integers) who attended class today.

A student comes to you claiming they were present, but they are worried their attendance wasn't marked correctly. They provide you with their specific Student ID. Your task is to verify if their ID exists in your attendance log. If it exists, you need to identify exactly where in the list it appears so you can show them. If it does not exist, you must confirm they are marked absent.

---

### 📥 Inputs

1. **Integer $N$**: Representing the total number of students in the attendance log.
2. **Array $A$**: Of $N$ integers, representing the Student IDs present in the log.
3. **Integer $K$**: Representing the specific Student ID to search for.

### 📤 Outputs

* The **0-based index** of the student ID $K$ if it exists in the array $A$.
* **-1** if the student ID is not found in the list.

### ⚠️ Constraints

* $1 \le N \le 10^5$ (The class size can be large)
* $-10^9 \le A[i] \le 10^9$ (Student IDs can be any standard integer)
* $-10^9 \le K \le 10^9$
* The list $A$ is **unsorted** (IDs were logged as students arrived).

### 🔍 Edge-Case Thinking Prompts

* **Empty Log:** What if the attendance log is completely empty ($N=0$)?
* **Start of List:** What if the student ID we are looking for is the very first name on the list?
* **End of List:** What if the student ID is the very last name on the list?
* **Duplicates:** What if the student ID appears multiple times? (Do we return the first occurrence or any occurrence?)
* **Negative Values:** What if the student ID is negative (e.g., a system error or specific coding format)?

### 🧪 Sample Inputs & Outputs

**Sample Case 1**

* **Input:**

    ```text
    5
    101 204 305 402 101
    305
    ```

* **Output:** `2`
* **Explanation:** The ID `305` is found at index `2` (0-based).

**Sample Case 2**

* **Input:**

    ```text
    4
    10 20 30 40
    99
    ```

* **Output:** `-1`
* **Explanation:** The ID `99` is not in the list.

### 🧠 Thinking Like a Programmer

| Question | Answer / Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **What must be tracked?** | We need to track our current position (**index**) as we scan through the list. |
| **What can change?** | The index we are currently inspecting moves from the start of the list to the end. |
| **What must never change?** | The **Target ID ($K$)** and the entries in the **attendance log ($A$)**. |
| **What brute force would do?** | Look at the first ID, check if it matches $K$. If not, look at the second, until the end or found. |

> **Note:** Since the array is unsorted, we have no choice but to check each element one by one. This is the essence of **Linear Search**.
