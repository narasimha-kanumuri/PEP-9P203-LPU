# Problem Story / Context

You are given access to a black-box boolean function `f(i)` defined over an index range `[0, N)`.

The function has the following property:

- There exists some index `p` such that:
  - For all `i < p`, `f(i) = false`
  - For all `i ≥ p`, `f(i) = true`

In other words, the function transitions from `false` to `true` exactly once and never switches back.

Your task is to determine the **smallest index `p` where `f(p)` becomes true**.

⚠️ Important:
- You cannot inspect the internal logic of `f(i)`.
- Each evaluation of `f(i)` is considered expensive.
- You must minimize the number of function calls.

# Inputs

- An integer `N` representing the size of the search space.
- Access to a boolean function `f(i)` defined for all `0 ≤ i < N`.

---

# Outputs

- Return the smallest index `p` such that `f(p) = true`.
- If no such index exists, return `-1`.

---

# Constraints

- `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9`
- `f(i)` evaluation is expensive (assume O(1) per call but limited calls allowed)
- Function is guaranteed to be monotonic:
  - Once true, always true afterward.

---

# Edge-Case Thinking Prompts

- What if `f(0)` is already true?
- What if `f(i)` is false for all `i`?
- What if the transition occurs at the last index?
- How many function calls would a linear scan require?
- How do you guarantee minimal evaluations?

# Sample Inputs & Outputs

## Example 1

Input:
N = 10  
Transition index p = 4  

f(i) values:
[false, false, false, false, true, true, true, true, true, true]

Output:
4

## Example 2

Input:
N = 5  
f(i) values:
[false, false, false, false, false]

Output:
-1

## Thinking Like a Programmer

### What must be tracked?
- Search boundaries (left and right limits)
- Midpoint evaluation
- Current candidate answer

### What can change?
- Search interval
- Mid index
- Evaluation results

### What must never change?
- The monotonic property:
  - false → false → false → true → true → true

### What brute force would do?
- Evaluate `f(i)` sequentially from 0 to N-1.
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Too slow for N up to 10^9.
