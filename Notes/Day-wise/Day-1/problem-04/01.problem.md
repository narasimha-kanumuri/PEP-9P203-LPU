## 1️⃣ Title

Maximum Length Substring Containing At Most K Distinct Characters

---

## 2️⃣ Problem Story / Context

A communication monitoring system analyzes message streams.

Given a string representing a continuous stream of characters,  
the system wants to determine:

What is the **maximum length of a contiguous substring** that contains **at most K distinct characters**?

This helps measure how long the system stays within a limited diversity threshold.

You must compute the maximum possible length efficiently.

---

## 3️⃣ Inputs

- Integer N — length of the string  
- String S of length N (lowercase English letters only)  
- Integer K — maximum allowed distinct characters  

---

## 4️⃣ Outputs

- Integer representing the maximum length of a valid substring  

---

## 5️⃣ Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5  
- 1 ≤ K ≤ 26  
- String contains only lowercase English letters  

---

## 6️⃣ Edge-Case Thinking Prompts

- What if K = 1?
- What if K ≥ number of distinct characters in the string?
- What if all characters are identical?
- What if K = 0? (Is that allowed?)
- How does brute force behave?
- What must always remain true inside a valid window?

## 7️⃣ Sample Inputs & Outputs

### Example 1

Input:
N = 7  
S = "ecebaaa"  
K = 2  

Output:
4  

Explanation:
The longest valid substring is "baaa" (length 4).

---

### Example 2

Input:
N = 6  
S = "aaabbb"  
K = 1  

Output:
3  

Explanation:
Valid substrings include "aaa" or "bbb".

## 8️⃣ Thinking Like a Programmer

- What must be tracked?
  → Character frequencies inside a moving window.

- What can change?
  → Window boundaries (left and right pointers).

- What must never change?
  → The number of distinct characters inside the window must be ≤ K.

- What would brute force do?
  → Try all substrings → O(N²) and check distinct count each time.

- What structural strategy might allow shrinking and expanding efficiently?
  → Maintain a dynamic window while preserving an invariant.
